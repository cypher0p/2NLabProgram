Write a program to implement data structure operations on array. For this purpose we will create an interface
myArray which will contain abstract methods corresponding to 5  data structure operation
1.insert
2.Delete
3. Treverse
4. search
5. sort

Create an implementation class called my array implementation This class will inherit myArray interface and
contain two private fields integer array and in it index. This class will also contain a parameterised
constructor which accepts 1 arguments that is the size of the array
